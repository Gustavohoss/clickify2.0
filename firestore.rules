/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for LaunchPad AI.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and provides public read access to pricing plans, AI models, and AI templates.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own profile data.
 * - Pricing plans are stored in the `/plans/{planId}` collection and are publicly readable.
 * - AI models are stored in the `/ai_models/{aiModelId}` collection and are publicly readable.
 * - AI templates are stored under `/ai_models/{aiModelId}/ai_templates/{aiTemplateId}` and are publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly controlled via path-based ownership.
 * - Listing of all users is disallowed.
 * - Pricing plans, AI models, and AI templates are publicly readable to facilitate easy access to application resources.
